# Rain Alert Script

A small Python automation script that checks upcoming weather conditions and alerts the user if rain is forecast.

## Overview

This script uses a public weather API to retrieve short-term forecast data and determines whether rain is expected. It is designed as a lightweight automation exercise demonstrating API usage, JSON parsing, and conditional logic in Python.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **REST API** (OpenWeather)
- **HTTP requests**
- **JSON data processing**

## Purpose

This project was created as a simple automation task to practise:
- Working with external APIs
- Handling API responses
- Writing clear, readable Python scripts

## Possible Extensions

- Email or SMS notifications
- Scheduled execution (cron / task scheduler)
- Location-based configuration
